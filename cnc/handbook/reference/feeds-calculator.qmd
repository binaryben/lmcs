# Feeds calculator


Common machining formulas
Speeds and feeds formulas – Make sure you don’t mix inches and mm! Always stay in the same units

Feed rate (inches per minute) = RPM x feed per tooth x number of teeth/flutes in cutter
Surface feet per minute = RPM x diameter of cutter / 3.82
RPM = surface feet per minute x 3.82 / diameter of cutter
Inches per Tooth = inches per minute / RPM / number of teeth/flutes in cutter


Conversion formulas

Inches = mm / 25.4
MM = inches x 25.4
Diameter = radius x 2
Radius = diameter / 2

From Richard

Tooth loading 0.01 to 0.08

TL x TN  x RPM / 1000 = Feed in metres/minute

12-15000rpm
1mm deep


CD x pi x RPM / 1000 = surface speed in meters

Surface speed should be:
200 for plastic/acrylic/aluminium
250 soft wood
350 hard wood

If it’s vibrating - feed rate too low
Screaming - feed rate too high

Plastic (1000mm/min, 9000rpm)
Aluminium (500mm/min 9000rpm)
